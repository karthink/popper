#+title: Popper.el

Popper is a minor-mode to tame the flood of ephemeral windows Emacs produces,
while still keeping them within arm's reach. Designate any buffer to "popup"
status, and it will stay out of your way. Disimss or summon it easily with one
key. Cycle through all your "popups" or just the ones relevant to your current
buffer. Useful for many things, including toggling display of REPLs,
documentation, compilation or shell output, etc.

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-xUNlZi3rI][detailed demo of Popper here]].

By default, popper will display your popups in a non-obtrusive way, but it works
best in conjunction with some system to handle window creation and placement,
like =shackle.el=. This package summons windows defined by the user as "popups"
by simply calling =display-buffer=.

You can pre-designate any buffer (by name or major-mode) as a popup, and the
status will be automatically applied when Emacs creates it.

**** Toggle a popup: 
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px

**** Cycle through all your popups:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-cycle.gif]]
**** Turn a regular window into a popup:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-demote.gif]]

You can also promote a popup to a normal window.
**** Or toggle all your popups at once:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px

* Usage
To designate popups in your init file, see the customization section.

There are two primary commands, you can bind them as convenient:

- =popper-toggle-latest=: Show/hide the latest popup. Does more with prefix args.
- =popper-cycle=: Cycle through your popups in sequence. With a prefix arg, cycle backwards.

Additionally, you can turn a regular window into a popup (or vice-versa) with =popper-toggle-type=, and kill an open popup buffer with =popper-kill-latest-popup=.

* Setup 
=popper= is available in MELPA, so you can install it with =M-x package-install RET popper RET= after adding MELPA to your package archives list.

** With =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popper
    :ensure t ; or :straight t
    :bind (("C-`"   . popper-toggle-latest)
           ("M-`"   . popper-cycle)
           ("C-M-`" . popper-toggle-type))
    :init
    (setq popper-reference-buffers
          '("\\*Messages\\*"
            "Output\\*$"
            help-mode
            compilation-mode))
    (popper-mode +1))
#+END_SRC
See [[*Customization][Customization]] for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

** Without =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'popper)
  (setq popper-reference-buffers
        '("\\*Messages\\*"
          "Output\\*$"
          help-mode
          compilation-mode))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-`") 'popper-toggle-latest)  
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-`") 'popper-cycle)  
  (popper-mode +1)
#+END_SRC
See [[*Customization][Customization]] for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ce27af55-91a5-4549-97ac-d7f2c0aa9019
:END:
To get started, customize this variable:

- =popper-reference-buffers=: List of buffers to treat as popups. Each entry in the list can be a regexp (string) to match buffer names against, or a major-mode (symbol) to match buffer major-modes against.

  Example: 

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    '("\\*Messages\\*"
      "Output\\*$"
      help-mode
      compilation-mode)
  #+END_SRC

  Will treat the following as popups: The Messages buffer, any buffer ending in "Output*", and all help and compilation buffers.

  There are other customization options, check the =popper= group.

** Grouping popups by context
Popper can group popups by "context", so that the popups available for display are limited to those that are relevant to the context in which =popper-toggle-latest= or =popper-cycle= is called. For example, when cycling popups from a project buffer, you may only want to see the popups (REPLs, help buffers and compilation output, say) that were spawned from buffers in that project. This is intended to approximate DWIM behavior, so that the most relevant popup in any context is never more than one command away.

Built in contexts include projects as defined in Emacs' built in =project.el= and =projectile=, as well as the default directory of a buffer. To set this, customize =popper-group-function= or use one of

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-project) ; project.el projects

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-projectile) ; projectile projects

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-directory) ; group by project.el
                                                           ; project root, with
                                                           ; fall back to
                                                           ; default-directory
#+END_SRC

You can also provide a custom function that takes no arguments, is executed in the context of a popup buffer and returns a string or symbol that represents the group/context it belongs to. This function will group all popups under the symbol =my-popup-group=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun popper-group-by-my-rule ()
  "This function is called with each popup buffer as current, so
  you can use buffer-local variables. This function should return
  a string or symbol that acts as the group name for this
  buffer."
  'my-popup-group)

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-my-rule)
#+END_SRC

**  Managing popup placement
In keeping with the principle of least surprise, all popups are shown in the same location: At the bottom of the frame. You can customize =popper-display-function= to change how popups are displayed.

However this means you can't have more than one popup open at a time. You may also want more control over where individual popups appear. For example, you may want an IDE-like set-up, with all help windows open on the right, REPLs on top and compilation windows at the bottom. This is best done by customizing Emacs' =display-buffer-alist=. Since this is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display.html#The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display][singularly confusing task]], I recommend using =popper= with a package that locks window placements, /e.g./ [[https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/][Shackle]].

*** Default popup placement:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-display-control t)  ;This is the DEFAULT behavior
#+end_src

You can customize =popper-display-function= to show popups any way you'd like.
Any =display-buffer= [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer-Display-Action-Functions.html][action function]] can work, or you can write your own. For
example, setting it to =display-buffer-in-child-frame= will cause popups to be
displayed in a child frame.

*** Popup placement controlled using =display-buffer-alist= or =shackle.el=:
If you already have rules in place for how various buffers should be displayed, such as by customizing =display-buffer-alist= or with =shackle.el=, popper will respect them: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package shackle
   ;; -- shackle rules here --
   )

  (use-package popper
  ;; -- popper customizations here--

  :config
  (setq popper-display-control nil))
#+end_src

* Technical notes
=popper= uses a buffer local variable (=popper-popup-status=) to identify if a given buffer should be treated as a popup. Matching is always by buffer and not window, so having two windows of a buffer, one treated as a popup and one as a regular window, isn't possible (although you can do this with indirect clones). In addition, it maintains an alist of popup windows/buffers for cycling through.

By default, it installs a single rule in =display-buffer-alist= to handle displaying popups. If =popper-display-control= is set to =nil=, this rule is ignored. You can change how the popups are shown by customizing =popper-display-function=, the function used by =display-buffer= to display popups, although you are better off customizing =display-buffer-alist= directly or using Shackle.
