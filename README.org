#+title: Popper.el

/New in v0.40: Auto-hide or suppress popup buffers, assign popups by predicate/

Popper is a minor-mode to tame the flood of ephemeral windows Emacs produces,
while still keeping them within arm's reach. Designate any buffer to "popup"
status, and it will stay out of your way. Disimss or summon it easily with one
key. Cycle through all your "popups" or just the ones relevant to your current
buffer. Useful for many things, including toggling display of REPLs,
documentation, compilation or shell output, etc.

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-xUNlZi3rI][detailed demo of Popper here]].

You can pre-designate any buffer (by name or major-mode) as a popup, and the
status will be automatically applied when Emacs creates it.

By default, your popups are displayed in a non-obtrusive way, but Popper
respects window rules for buffers that you might have in =display-buffer-alist=
or created using a window management package like =shackle.el=. Popper summons
windows defined by the user as "popups" by simply calling =display-buffer=.

**** Toggle a popup: 
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-toggle-latest.gif]]
**** Cycle through all your popups:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-cycle.gif]]
**** Turn a regular window into a popup:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popper-demote.gif]]

You can also promote a popup to a normal window.
**** Or toggle all your popups at once:
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px

* Usage
To designate popups in your init file, see the customization section.

There are two primary commands, you can bind them as convenient:

- =popper-toggle-latest=: Show/hide the latest popup. Does more with prefix args.
- =popper-cycle=: Cycle through your popups in sequence. With a prefix arg, cycle backwards.

Additionally, you can turn a regular window into a popup (or vice-versa) with =popper-toggle-type=, and kill an open popup buffer with =popper-kill-latest-popup=.

* Setup 
=popper= is available in MELPA, so you can install it with =M-x package-install RET popper RET= after adding MELPA to your package archives list.

** With =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popper
    :ensure t ; or :straight t
    :bind (("C-`"   . popper-toggle-latest)
           ("M-`"   . popper-cycle)
           ("C-M-`" . popper-toggle-type))
    :init
    (setq popper-reference-buffers
          '("\\*Messages\\*"
            "Output\\*$"
            "\\*Async Shell Command\\*"
            help-mode
            compilation-mode))
    (popper-mode +1))
#+END_SRC
See the Customization section for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

** Without =use-package=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'popper)
  (setq popper-reference-buffers
        '("\\*Messages\\*"
          "Output\\*$"
          "\\*Async Shell Command\\*"
          help-mode
          compilation-mode))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-`") 'popper-toggle-latest)  
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-`") 'popper-cycle)  
  (popper-mode +1)
#+END_SRC
See the Customization section for details on specifying buffer types as popups.

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ce27af55-91a5-4549-97ac-d7f2c0aa9019
:END:
To get started, customize this variable:

- =popper-reference-buffers=: List of buffers to treat as popups. Each entry in the list can be a regexp (string) to match buffer names against or a major-mode (symbol) to match buffer major-modes against.

  Example: 

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq popper-reference-buffers
          '("\\*Messages\\*"
            "Output\\*$"
            help-mode
            compilation-mode))
  #+END_SRC

  Will treat the following as popups: The Messages buffer, any buffer ending in "Output*", and all help and compilation buffers.

  As of v0.40, Popper also supports classifying a buffer as a popup based on any user supplied predicate. This predicate (function) is called with the buffer as argument and returns =t= if it should be considered a popup. Here is an example with a predicate:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq popper-reference-buffers
          '("\\*Messages\\*"
            help-mode
            (lambda (buf) (with-current-buffer buf
                       (and (derived-mode-p 'fundamental-mode)
                            (< (count-lines (point-min) (point-max))
                               10)))))))
  #+END_SRC
  
  This list includes the the Messages and =help-mode= buffers from before, along with a predicate: any buffer derived from the major mode =fundamental-mode= that has fewer than 10 lines will be considered a popup. 

  Note that for performance reasons, predicates that classify a buffer as a popup are /only run when the buffer is created/. Thus dynamically changing a buffer's popup status based on its changing state is not possible (yet).
  
  There are other customization options, check the =popper= group.

** Grouping popups by context
Popper can group popups by "context", so that the popups available for display are limited to those that are relevant to the context in which =popper-toggle-latest= or =popper-cycle= is called. For example, when cycling popups from a project buffer, you may only want to see the popups (REPLs, help buffers and compilation output, say) that were spawned from buffers in that project. This is intended to approximate DWIM behavior, so that the most relevant popup in any context is never more than one command away.

Built in contexts include projects as defined in Emacs' built in =project.el= and =projectile=, using =perspective= names (from =persp.el=), as well as the default directory of a buffer. To set this, customize =popper-group-function= or use one of

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-project) ; project.el projects

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-projectile) ; projectile projects

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-directory) ; group by project.el
                                                           ; project root, with
                                                           ; fall back to
                                                           ; default-directory
  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-perspective) ; group by perspective
#+END_SRC

You can also provide a custom function that takes no arguments, is executed in the context of a popup buffer and returns a string or symbol that represents the group/context it belongs to. This function will group all popups under the symbol =my-popup-group=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun popper-group-by-my-rule ()
    "This function should return a string or symbol that is the
  name of the group this buffer belongs to. It is called with each
  popup buffer as current, so you can use buffer-local variables."

    'my-popup-group)

  (setq popper-group-function #'popper-group-by-my-rule)
#+END_SRC

** Managing popup placement
In keeping with the principle of least surprise, all popups are shown in the same location: At the bottom of the frame. You can customize =popper-display-function= to change how popups are displayed.

However this means you can't have more than one popup open at a time. You may also want more control over where individual popups appear. For example, you may want an IDE-like set-up, with all help windows open on the right, REPLs on top and compilation windows at the bottom. This is best done by customizing Emacs' =display-buffer-alist=. Since this is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display.html#The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display][singularly confusing task]], I recommend using =popper= with a package that locks window placements, /e.g./ [[https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/][Shackle]].

*** Default popup placement:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-display-control t)  ;This is the DEFAULT behavior
#+end_src
You can customize =popper-display-function= to show popups any way you'd like.
Any =display-buffer= [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer-Display-Action-Functions.html][action function]] can work, or you can write your own. For
example, setting it as
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-display-function #'display-buffer-in-child-frame)
#+END_SRC
will cause popups to be displayed in a child frame.

*** Popup placement controlled using =display-buffer-alist= or =shackle.el=:
If you already have rules in place for how various buffers should be displayed, such as by customizing =display-buffer-alist= or with =shackle.el=, popper will respect them once you set =popper-display-control= to nil:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package shackle
   ;; -- shackle rules here --
   )

  (use-package popper
  ;; -- popper customizations here--

  :config
  (setq popper-display-control nil))
#+end_src

** Suppressing popups
Popper can suppress popups when they are first created. The buffer will be registered in the list of popups but will not show up on your screen. Instead, a message ("Popup suppressed: $buffer-name") will be printed to the echo area. You can then raise it using =popper-toggle-latest= or =popper-cycle= at your convenience. It behaves as a regular popup from that point on:

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8607532/132929265-37eee976-131f-4631-9bad-73090bf17231.mp4]]
# [[file:images/popper-hide-popup.gif]]

To specify popups to auto-hide, use a cons cell with the =hide= symbol when specifying =popup-reference-buffers=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq popper-reference-buffers
      '(("Output\\*$" . hide)
        (completion-list-mode . hide)
        occur-mode
        "\\*Messages\\*"))
#+end_src

This assignment will suppress all buffers ending in =Output*= and the Completions buffer. The other entries are treated as normal popups.

You can combine the hiding feature with predicates for classifying buffers as popups:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun popper-shell-output-empty-p (buf)
    (and (string-match-p "\\*Async Shell Command\\*" (buffer-name buf))
         (= (buffer-size buf) 0)))

  (add-to-list 'popper-reference-buffers
               '(popper-shell-output-empty-p . hide))
#+END_SRC

This assignment will suppress display of the async shell command output buffer, but only when there is no output (stdout). Once it is hidden it will be treated as a popup on par with other entries in =popper-reference-buffers=.

* Technical notes
=popper= uses a buffer local variable (=popper-popup-status=) to identify if a given buffer should be treated as a popup. Matching is always by buffer and not window, so having two windows of a buffer, one treated as a popup and one as a regular window, isn't possible (although you can do this with indirect clones). In addition, it maintains an alist of popup windows/buffers for cycling through.

By default, it installs a single rule in =display-buffer-alist= to handle displaying popups. If =popper-display-control= is set to =nil=, this rule is ignored. You can change how the popups are shown by customizing =popper-display-function=, the function used by =display-buffer= to display popups, although you are better off customizing =display-buffer-alist= directly or using Shackle.
