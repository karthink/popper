;;; Commentary:

;; Popper is a minor-mode to tame the flood of ephemeral windows Emacs
;; produces, while still keeping them within arm's reach. Designate any
;; buffer to "popup" status, and it will stay out of your way. Disimss
;; or summon it easily with one key. Cycle through all your "popups" or
;; just the ones relevant to your current buffer. Useful for many
;; things, including toggling display of REPLs, documentation,
;; compilation or shell output, etc.
;;
;; For a demo describing usage and customization see
;; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-xUNlZi3rI
;;
;; COMMANDS:
;;
;; popper-toggle-latest : Toggle latest popup
;; popper-cycle         : Cycle through all popups, or close all open popups
;; popper-toggle-type   : Turn a regular window into a popup or vice-versa
;; popper-kill-latest-popup : Kill latest open popup
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;
;; `popper-reference-buffers': A list of major modes or regexps whose
;; corresponding buffer major-modes or regexps (respectively) should be
;; treated as popups.
;;
;; `popper-mode-line': String or sexp to show in the mode-line of
;; popper. Setting this to nil removes the mode-line entirely from
;; popper.
;;
;; `popper-group-function': Function that returns the context a popup
;; should be shown in. The context is a string or symbol used to group
;; together a set of buffers and their associated popups, such as the
;; project root. Customize for available options.
;;
;; `popper-display-control': This package summons windows defined by the
;; user as popups by simply calling `display-buffer'. By default,
;; it will display your popups in a non-obtrusive way. If you want
;; Popper to display popups according to window rules you specify in
;; `display-buffer-alist' (or through a package like Shackle), set this
;; variable to nil.
